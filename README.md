# Freecode Camp

This repo is not intended for an app, instead it is more of a workbook showing my progress and completed exercises on [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org). The main purpose is to hold code and other files to be used when completing courses on freecodecamp that require a submission link to complete.

If you are new to coding or in general just want to learn something new I do highly suggest heading over to freecodecamp to learn more and get started.
